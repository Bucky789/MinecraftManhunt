🧭 Minecraft Manhunt Plugin (1.16.1)
A custom Minecraft plugin that brings Dream-style Manhunt gameplay to your local Spigot server! One player is the Speedrunner, and the rest are Hunters equipped with compasses that track the runner — even in the Nether.

🎮 Features
🔄 Automatically assigns 1 speedrunner and multiple hunters

🧭 Hunters receive compasses that track the speedrunner

Compass works in both Overworld and Nether using Lodestone mechanics

💀 Hunters automatically receive a new compass when they respawn

📍 /startmanhunt command to start the game with online players

♻️ Resets player gamemodes and teleports everyone to the starter
